## About Site

- [Lume](https://lume.land/) as static site generator

Interesting facts, this site:

- is so minimal that every page is about 2-3kb, it's insane!
- has dark/light mode!
- doesn't track you!
- is using [UTOPIA](https://utopia.fyi/) for fluid type font size, so it's readable, no need for **@media queries**.
- is using your default font, so no need to download 100kb for just text!
- IDK what to tell but you can see the source code on [github](https://github.com/cevdetarda/site/)
